1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Software Defect Prediction NASA
3. Data processing using pandas dataframe
	- converting str to float and integer
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Feature Selection & Data Sampling 
	- SMOTE - Oversampling
	- KMFOS Sampling
		- Reduce number of entries(rows)
	- Splitting Data for FFNN
6. Building the model
	- Logistic Regression
	- SVM
	- Naive Bayes
	- Random Forest
	- OS-ELM
	- XGBoost
	- Bagging Classifier
	- Boosting Classifier
	- Gradient Boosting
	- Voting Classifier
	- Stacking Classifier
	- Feed Forward Neural Network

7. Training the model
8. Building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better score around 98 comparing with Other Models 
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. Importing the packages
11. User gives input as Feature Values 
12. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
13. Trained model is used for prediction
14. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension - Voting Classifier, Stacking Classifier is build as Extension for feature values
and Voting Classifier is used for prediction since we it gives better score  comparing with other Models
